## 🎮 Game Modes

- **Solo** → Play alone and survive as long as possible.  
- **Co-op** → Two players team up. When a brick is triggered, only the triggering player is vulnerable — the partner has temporary immunity.  
- **Multiplayer (2P)** → Two-player competitive mode. No immunity — last player standing wins.  
- **Triple Player (3P)** → Three-player battle royale mode. No immunity — every brick counts.
